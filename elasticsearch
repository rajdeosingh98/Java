If you are running to nodes on one machine, it is probably better to add ports to your configuration.

 discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["machine1:9300", "machine2:9300", "machine2:9301"]
Than also configure the ports yourself so you know which node has which port:

 transport.tcp.port: 9300
 http.port: 9200
